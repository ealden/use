## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an Agile Coach at [Odd-e](http://odd-e.com).

## What hardware do you use?

I currently have a 13" 2010 MacBook Pro.  RAM was upgraded to 8GiB and the hard drive replaced with a 240GiB SSD.  I have a drive bay extender but I'm waiting until my AppleCare expires before I install it.

I also have a 2012 Mac mini.  This is the Core i7 version with RAM bumped up to 16GiB.  The Mac mini drives a 27" Samsung LED monitor via HDMI for a 1080p display.  I prefer to use the Mac mini more at home as it is considerably more powerful that my MacBook Pro, even if the hard drive is not an SSD.

I have a 32GiB Black iPhone 5 as well as a 32GiB Black iPad 3 with Cellular when I'm on the go.  There is a 2TB Time Capsule to power the home network, and an Apple TV 3 connected to a 51" Samsung Plasma TV when I watch stuff.

## And what software?

Vim is currently my editor, and I'm trying to spend more time on it so I can be awesome.  I used to use Emacs.  I fire up IntelliJ IDEA if I need to do Java, but I'd rather not do that.

## What would be your dream setup?

I'm disappointed that Apple did not announce new Haswell-based MacBook Pros in the 2013 WWDC, as I'm planning to upgrade.  I'm aiming for a 15" with 512GiB SSD and 16GiB RAM, assuming Apple did not bump up the specs.  I got spoiled by my Mac mini with it's i7 and 16GiB RAM.  I would think twice if Apple released a 13" with those specs.

I plan to get a 32GiB iPad mini if one with a Retina screen comes up.  I'm also looking if I should put a second 27" LCD monitor to my Mac mini, though my table won't be able to fit it.  I've been eyeing a Cinema display if it's as thin as the latest iMacs, but then again I find them too expensive.

Well, to answer the question, I think I would like a Mac Pro with 3 Cinema displays.
