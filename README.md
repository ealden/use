## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an Agile Coach at [Odd-e](http://odd-e.com).

## What hardware do you use?

I am mostly on a go, and I rely on a 2013 13" Retina MacBook Pro, iPhone 5, and Retina iPad mini with cellular.  The MacBook Pro is the high-end version, with a 2.6Ghz Core i5, 512GiB SSD, and 8GiB RAM.  I was hoping to get the BTO option and upgrade to 16GiB RAM, but delivery takes a very long time here in the Philippines.  The iPhone is 32GiB while the iPad mini is 64GiB, as I got it on release day here in the Philippines and no other stock was available.  The iPhone and iPad mini are in black (or whatever Apple calls them officially). 

I also carry a Fujifilm X100S camera, which is a joy to use. I added a leather strap, lens hood, and protective filter so I can just leave it in the bag and easily take out to shoot.  I carry all this gear in a Timbuk2 Shift Pannier messenger bag. 

I also have a 2012 Mac mini connected to a 27" Samsung LED monitor via HMI.  The Mac mini has a Core i7 with RAM maxed out at 16GiB. I find that I sit better in front of my Mac mini, though the lack of a Retina display is annoying.  There is a 2TB Time Capsule in the home network, and 2 Apple TVs, a 3rd gen in the bedroom and 2nd gen in the living room, when I watch stuff. 

## And what software?

Vim is currently my editor, and I'm trying to spend more time on it so I can be awesome.  I used to use Emacs.  I fire up IntelliJ IDEA if I need to do Java, but I'd rather not do that.

## What would be your dream setup?

That 2013 Mac Pro looks amazing.
